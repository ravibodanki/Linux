df ( disk filesystem)  -
          It is used to report file system disk space usage, showing how much space is used and available on mounted file systems.
df -h 
df -m 

In Windows, drives such as C:, D:, and E: are logical designations assigned to storage devices or partitions. Each drive letter represents a separate filesystem namespace, allowing users and applications to access files and directories on that specific storage unit. 


In Linux, the concept of drive letters like C:, D:, and E: does not exist. Instead, Linux uses a single hierarchical directory structure that begins at the root directory (/). All storage devices, partitions, and network filesystems are integrated into this hierarchy by mounting them at specific directories

change the ownership of files and directories.:


chmod (FILE PERMISSIONS) 

The chmod command in Linux is used to change the file permissions. Permissions dictate who can read, write, or execute a file. Here's a comprehensive guide on using the chmod command:


There are three types of users:

u – the file owner (user)
g – the group to which the file belongs
o – others - everyone else 
a – all (user, group, and others)

------------------
change the permissions of a file or directory --  madhu 

owner/user    |  group  | others 

rwx               rwx     rwx 

r - read - 4
w - write - 2
x - execute - 1 


Modes
Modes can be specified using symbolic or numeric (octal) notation.

Symbolic Notation
r – read permission
w – write permission
x – execute permission



Numeric (Octal) Notation
4 – read permission
2 – write permission
1 – execute permission

The numeric mode is a combination of these values. For example:

7 – read, write, and execute (4 + 2 + 1)
6 – read and write (4 + 2)
5 – read and execute (4 + 1)
4 – read only

Set directory to allow access only to owner:
================================================

What is a Group?
A group is a collection of users. It helps manage permissions for multiple users efficiently.

Each file in Linux is owned by:

One user (owner)

One group

==========================================
/etc/passwd	------   Stores user info (usernames, UID, shell, home)
/etc/group	-------  Lists groups and their members
/etc/shadow	------    Stores encrypted passwords

Shared Directory for Team::

groupadd team
usermod -aG team madhu
usermod -aG team kiran
mkdir /project
chown root:team /project
chmod 770 /project

======================================

CHOWN :

change the ownership of files and directories.

FILE & DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP :

The chown command in Linux is used to change the ownership of files and directories. This command allows you to change both the user and group ownership of a file or directory.

chown [options] user[:group] file(s)

1. Change the Owner of a File:

      chown newuser filename
	  
2. Change the Group of a File:
	  
	  chown :newgroup filename

3.Change Both the Owner and Group of a File:
     
	  chown newuser:newgroup filename
	  
4. Change the Owner and Group of Multiple Files:

     chown newuser:newgroup file1 file2 file3


5.-R – Change ownership recursively for directories and their contents:
chown -R newuser:newgroup /path/to/directory

ps --> running processes on a system. It provides a snapshot of the currently active processes, including details like process IDs (PIDs), memory usage, CPU time, and more.

ps -ef 
Shows processes for all users, not just the current session.


ps -ef | grep tomcat 

ps -aux 
ps -u $USER
